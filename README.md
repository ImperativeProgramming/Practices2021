## Schedule
Our classes go from the 7th of September until the 12th of December may change according to [Academic calendar](https://www.elte.hu/en/academic-calendar)

* We have Autumn break from the October 26th until October 31st

## EXAM DATES

[Exam dates will be here as soon as available]


## Evaluation Method
* Only final grade can be rounded up or down
  * The judgement of rounding is done by the lecturers based in presence, grades and final exam performance.
* If there is no rule for the calculation, simple average calculation will take place;


## Evaluation calculation
- During the semester we will have 10 microexams(e.g. quizzes) with 10 points each;
- There will be 6 assignments for maximum 3 points each. The five best results are taken into consideration. (15 points)
- At the end of the semester there will be a programming exam for 15 points.


## Class exercises
- Every class is subject of having small evaluations.
- Class evaluations aren't subject to retake without a valid reason.
- Class exercises have deadlines.

### Extra points
Extra points from classes are possible only for the exercises' grade, (e.g. pull requests may be subject to extra points).


## Absences

* Lab Presence is mandatory, remember to sign the presence sheet every class. If you fail on doing so, 3 unjustified absences automatically fails you.
  * **But I was traveling** Good for you :) But unless you have some justification that is just another absence;
  * **But I was sick** Send a proof of it to the lecturer e-mail;
  * **But I really needed to skip the class** Send your justification to the lecturer's e-mail and the course team will evaluate it.
  * **But I arrived super late in the semester** Once again, send it to the lecturer, this information will be verified with the university administration and the course team will decide each case.
  * **But I was about to sign the presence sheet then I got distracted by a gnome that was passing by the classroom, passed the sheet on and forgot to sign it by the end of the class even though it was there all the time.** Really? OMG! Fortunately you can have 3 absences.

* In the case of online classes, the presence will be aknowledged by other means (e.g. quiz participation, online status on Teams etc)

## No Babysitting

You are the responsible for your exercises and your learning, if that's not happening, you are the one who needs to seek for help and responsible for your gears.

You are also the one responsible for managing your agenda and trips, no extra exams or tasks will be created to fit your agenda.

## Copies, plagiarism and others
Cheating exams or copying other's people work without the appropriate reference will fail you and cancel any chance of retake. In case of copied exam, both students fail regardless who was the original author.

Any sort of plagiarism, copies, ideological falsehood (e.g. fake documents) or unlawful behavior may be subject of auction following university regulations.
