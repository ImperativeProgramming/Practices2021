# First Class

Today's class is inspired in Professor Zoltán Porkoláb material also available [HERE](http://gsd.web.elte.hu/lectures/c-en/c-lecture-1/). We also will have lots of things coming from GeeksForGeeks tutorials, feel free to go further looking their content [HERE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-programming-language/)

## Cheatsheet for navigating on the command lines:

### Windows:

    # To navigate forward
    CD [FOLDER_NAME]

    # To navigate back
    CD..

    # Clean the screen
    CLS     

    # Show the current directory
    DIR


### Linux/Mac:
    # These commands work also on the lab machines

    # To navigate forward
    CD [FOLDER_NAME]

    # To navigate back
    CD ..

    # Clean the screen
    clear

    # Show the current directory
    ls

    # Create a new folder
    MKDIR [name of the folder]

    # See the text content of a file
    CAT [file name]

    # Copy a file
    CP [full file address] [address to the new file]

    # Move a file
    MV [full file address] [new file address]

    # Rename a file (yeah it's the same as the previous one)
    MV [full file address] [new file name]

    # Print the content of a variable/command
    ECHO [variable, command]

    # See the current folder address
    PWD

## Task
- Go on and try the commands, one by one, create a new folder inside Desktop with your name, close the terminal and try to navigate back in;

- Using the explorer create a text file and try to use the CAT command to read its content;

- Make a copy of the file;

- Rename the original with "original" at the end of its name;

- List the content of the current folder.


## Can I install the IDE now?
![Nope](https://media.giphy.com/media/1iTI7wQfPEJu1wjK/giphy.gif)

We won't have IDEs during this course, the reason is simple, if you can program without the IDE you can program with the IDE, the other way around isn't true.

As we saw in the introduction this knowledge is crucial for using modern solutions.

## Let's build our first Hello World program
* Code structure (the language we are going to use)

* The main method
* How to compile
* [Variables and Keywords](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/variables-and-keywords-in-c/)


## Compile?
